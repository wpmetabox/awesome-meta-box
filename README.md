# Awesome Meta Box

A public repo for everything useful for [Meta Box](https://metabox.io) users. That includes, but not limited to: plugins (on wordpress.org, Github, or somewhere on your personal site), code snippets, themes, and even blog posts.

## Why Awesome Meta Box?

We create this repo *for you* so you can:

- Look for what you need from the community, besides the official [extensions](https://metabox.io/plugins/) and [tutorials](https://docs.metabox.io/tutorials/).
- Share some work that you did with Meta Box. As it's useful for you (and your clients), it might be useful for other people as well.

We encourage you to try, build things with Meta Box and share with us! Self-promotion are welcome! The best resources will be collected and updated on the [Resources](https://metabox.io/resources/) page on our main website.
