# Awesome Meta Box

A public repo for everything useful for [Meta Box](https://metabox.io) users. That includes, but not limited to: plugins (on wordpress.org, Github, or somewhere on your personal site), code snippets, themes, and even blog posts.

## Why Awesome Meta Box?

We create this repo *for you* so you can:

- Look for what you need from the community, besides the official [extensions](https://metabox.io/plugins/) and [tutorials](https://docs.metabox.io/tutorials/).
- Share some work that you did with Meta Box. As it's useful for you (and your clients), it might be useful for other people as well.

We encourage you to try, build things with Meta Box and share with us! Self-promotion are welcome! The best resources will be collected and updated on the [Resources](https://metabox.io/resources/) page on our main website.

1. [MVI File Attachment](https://github.com/gaufde/mvi-file-attachment): A gated content plugin perfect for B2B sites. It handles creating and serving expiring download links and automatic CSV exports of submissions. Supports Mailchimp. Requires some paid MB extensions (not included).
1. [Math Operator Field](https://github.com/kevinlanteri/RWMB_math_operator_Field): RWMB_math_operator_Field is a custom field type that allows you to perform mathematical operations based on the values of other fields. It works with the Meta Box Builder (MBB) plugin and extends its functionality by adding a new field type called "Math Operation." This field type is useful when you need to calculate a value dynamically based on the inputs from other fields.

### Code snippets

1. [Timber Twig callback for MB Blocks](https://gist.github.com/jstask82/ec69915874aa4e72a4c42b3402a14a72): Use MB Blocks with Timber. Bare bones approach -> Field definitions are still set in PHP.
1. [Plugin dependency check](https://gist.github.com/0537da633ca78c62ffc06721057d162e): Checks your projects plugin dependencies, so your code won't break. Does not use Meta Box specific functions, but was created with Meta Box in mind.
